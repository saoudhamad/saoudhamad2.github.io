        <h1>DESCRIPTION OF COMOROS HOLIDAYS</h1>
        <p>Moored in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Mozambique, this stunning archipelago
          is truly off the beaten path. Our Comoros holidays will help you explore the best that it has to
           offer, from stunning beaches to volcanic landscapes, to cities packed with history and culture.</p>

            <p>Your tour kicks off on Grande Comore, the main island, where you’ll have time to explore
            the capital city of Moroni. It's a lively and enchanting place where medinas and markets rub
            shoulder with ancient sultans’ palaces – made all the more beguiling by the surrounding
            volcanic terrain.</p>

          <p>You’ll transfer to the island of Anjouan next, often thought of as the most beautiful island in the
          archipelago, full of luscious mountain terrain, lakes, waterfalls and, of course, gorgeous coastline.</p>

          <p>Then it’s on to the laid-back island of Mohéli, where days can be spent hiking in virgin
          rainforest, snorkelling in pristine waters, going whale and dolphin watching, and relaxing on
          beautiful beaches, which serve as turtle nesting sites at certain times of year. Returning to
          Moroni, there’s time to explore more of the town, or to hike to the summit of neighbouring Mt
          Karthala before your journey home.</p>

        <h1>DAY-BY-DAY ITINERARY</h1>
        <p > Day 1: Moroni - Arrive in Moroni, capital of the Comoros Islands. The rest of the day
          is at leisure to relax after your long flight or explore the town. Overnight Retaj
          Moroni Hotel* (formally known as the Le Moroni Hotel) or similar. (*please
          note that the Retaj Moroni Hotel does not serve alcohol)</p>
        <p>Day 2: Full Day Exploration of Grande Comore - Full day tour of Grande Comore
          with private car/driver and English speaking guide, including visits to
          Mitsaniouli village, a Ylang-Ylang plantation, Lac Salé (salt lake) and
          Chomoni with its excellent beach. Overnight Retaj Moroni Hotel* (formally
          known as the Le Moroni Hotel) or similar. (*please note that the Retaj Moroni
          Hotel does not serve alcohol). (BL)</p>
        <p>Day 3: Anjouan - Transfer to the airport for the short flight to Anjouan. On arrival
          you will be met and taken on a guided tour of the island, widely accepted as
          the most beautiful of the three islands which make up the Union of the
          Comoros. Overnight Al Amal Hotel or similar. (BL)</p>
        <p>Day 4: Anjouan - A day at leisure to simply relax or independently explore the
          island’s capital, Mutsamudu. Overnight Al Amal Hotel or similar. (B)</p>
        <p>Day 5: Mohéli - Morning transfer to the airport for the flight to Mohéli. Depending
          on the airlines’ schedule a connection may be required in Moroni. On arrival
          you will be met and transferred to Laka Lodge, a small and intimate resort
          with its own beach. There are a number of optional excursions available
          including trips to some of the smaller islands nearby, and evening visits to
          watch turtles lay their eggs in the sand. Overnight Laka Lodge. (BD)</p>
        <p>Day 6-7: Mohéli - Two days at leisure to enjoy this beautiful island. We have not pre-
          arranged any sightseeing or activities as Mohéli is very easy to explore
          independently or optional excursions can be arranged directly with the
          lodge. Relax and enjoy the different pace of life and meet the friendly local
          people. If you are feeling a little more energetic, you can arrange a guided
          hike across the island on tracks of virgin rainforest. Alternatively you can
          cycle around the island, on virtually empty roads. Then of course there are
          the beaches. Two of the most beautiful are Sambadjou and Nioumachoua.
          You can also snorkel to discover the rich marine life or even go whale and
          dolphin watching. Finally at certain times of the year you may be lucky
          enough to see giant turtles lay their eggs at night on Itsamia beaches.
          Overnight Laka Lodge. (BD)</p>
        <p>Day 8: Moroni - Return to Moroni with spare time to explore this charming town
          further. We stay at a resort a few kilometres out of town, with its own private
          beach. Another chance to soak up the sun and swim in the clear blue waters
          of the Indian Ocean. Overnight Golden Tulip Resort & Spa or similar. </p>
        <p>Day 9: Free day in Moroni or Mt Karthala climb - Today you have the option of
          leaving Moroni for a climb to the summit of Mt Karthala (2,361m). Although
          it is possible to do the climb in just one long day, we recommend that you
          camp at the summit in the crater itself and return the next day. For those not
          wishing to make the climb, you will have today and the next day to relax or
          perhaps enquire locally about the options to dive. Overnight Golden Tulip
          Resort & Spa or similar / camping.</p>
        <p>Day 10: Moroni - Your last day in the Comoros to either relax and unwind or take the
          opportunity to explore more of Grande Comore. Overnight Golden Tulip
          Resort & Spa or similar</p>
        <p>Day 11: Moroni - Tour ends.</p>
